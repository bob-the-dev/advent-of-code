[9 2] 3 4 5 -> i = 0 -> detect error, remove 0
x [2 3] 4 5 -> continue on, no issue
other solution?
[9 2 3] -> invalid
[2 3 4] -> valid
etc

[1 9] 2 3 4 -> i = 0 -> detect error, remove 0
x [9 2] 3 4 -> removing was not the solution, still error, remove 1 -> start over ?
1 x [2 3] 4 -> continue on, no issue 
[1 9 2] invalid
[9 2 3] invalid
[2 3 4] valid

6 5 [4 6] 2 1 -> i = 2 -> detect error, remove 2
6 5 x [6 2] 1 ->  removing was not the solution, still error, remove 3 -> start over ?
6 5 4 x [2 1] -> continue on, no issue

[6 5 4] valid
[5 4 6] invalid
[4 6 2] invalid

BUT, I'd rather not start over every time. 
Especially not with foreach.
Maybe slice the array from index and from index + 1, see if either solution has no errors, then the error count can not be over 2\

very invalid solution 

1 2 7 8 9 -> invalid option
[1 2 7] invalid
[2 7 8] invalid
[7 8 9] valid ... this does not help


if n was not there, would it be valid, then return. 
lists that are valid return immediately, otherwise n iterations based on length of array
